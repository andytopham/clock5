clock5
======

Alarm clock.
Code specifically for my "black box" hardware.
Drives bank of leds for wakeup light.
Drives 7segment display for clock and temperature information.
See source code for full details of hardware setup.

Issues
------

7segment display does always update correctly - an issue with the Sparkfun implementation.
